# 🃏 Card Battle Game in Python

This is a turn-based console card game built in Python. Two players compete by drawing cards from their decks, and the player with the higher card wins each round. In case of a tie, extra cards are drawn until a winner is decided.

## ✨ Features

- Full deck generation using 13 values and 4 suits.
- Random shuffle and fair deck distribution.
- Round-based card battles with visual console display.
- Tiebreaker logic by drawing 3 additional cards per player.
- End-game statistics: victories, rounds, and card distribution.

## 🔍 Game Rules

- The deck is split equally between two players.
- Each round, both players reveal one card.
- The player with the higher card wins the round and takes both cards.
- If cards have the same value, each player draws 3 extra cards and compares again.
- The game ends when one player runs out of cards.
- The winner is the player with remaining cards.

## 🛠️ Future Improvements

- Multiplayer mode over network 🌍.
- GUI using Tkinter or PyQt 🖥️.
